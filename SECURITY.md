# Security Policy

libVES-jvm provides the Java/JNI bindings for libVES.c — end-to-end encryption software on
which the confidentiality of real users' data depends. We take vulnerability reports
seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue, pull request, or discussion for security problems.**

Email **security@vesvault.com** with:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (a proof-of-concept if you have one),
- the affected version(s) or commit, and the platform (JVM/Android version, ABI).

If you need to share sensitive details, say so in your first message and we'll arrange an
encrypted channel.

We aim to **acknowledge** a report within 3 business days and to share an initial
**assessment** within 10 business days. We'll keep you updated and coordinate a disclosure
timeline with you — please give us a reasonable window to ship a fix before going public
(typically up to 90 days).

## Scope

**In scope:** the Java and JNI binding code in this repository — correct and safe exposure
of libVES.c through the JVM, key/VESkey handling across the JNI boundary, and memory
safety in the native layer. Issues in the underlying cryptography belong with libVES.c.

**Out of scope here:** the hosted VESvault service/API (email the same address — we route
it), libVES.c itself (report via the libVES.c repository), and third-party dependencies.

## Design & threat model

The recovery design and its explicit, documented threat model live in the libVES.c `doc/`
directory and at <https://ves.host>. Findings that contradict those claims are especially
valuable.

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest released version. Older versions are handled case by
case.
